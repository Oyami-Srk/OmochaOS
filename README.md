## Omocha OS - A Personal OS Project For Study

  Like all the high school student, young and ambitious maybe a little rude, considering nothing fearable, I am the same. Since the day I meet **computer science**, I knew that I have a dream - *understand what it is*.
  
  Operating System, which is called "Romance of Programmers", is what I want to learn and study for the time I wrote this readme (senior high grade 2). I wish I could keep this power for a life long time. Creating something new, making something turly valuable, spreading the knowlegde to everyone who likes is my simple dream.
  
  Thanks to the era of Internet, I could get all documents or books from Internet or book stores, which is especially lucky for kids like me born in that time. Knownledge is easy to touch, and I should make what I know easy to touch for anyone else, that was why I devote myself to open-source community.
  
  The codes I write is not so good. But I still want to share with anyone in the world. Any review will make me more powerful and grateful. Gaining a sense of achivement is the core of taking part in open-source community, That is what I thought.
  
  Thus, I will push my code no matter how badly I wrote, just for myself...
  
  Actually, I don't think anyone is going to see this, but I should keep the thought and heart in my mind, reminding me what I truly for and what I turly want.
  
  Best wishes to anyone in the world.
